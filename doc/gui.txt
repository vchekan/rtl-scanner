    Azul (unmaintained as of Jun 2019)
        Has descent documentation
        Is build with Html Dom like model (div, children, css styling and layout).
        I am not sure CSS is a good layout role model.
        No scrolling or content clipping yet.

        Piston has very bad review (design/code quality wise) in https://wiki.alopex.li/AGuideToRustGameFrameworks2019
    imgui
        Dear IMGUI. Consumes cpu in event loop.
